# Project Title: Global Environmental Sustainability Dashboard

Summary:
The objective of this project is to explore and visualize trends in environmental sustainability globally, focusing on three critical metrics: greenhouse gas emissions (based on industries), renewable energy consumption, and air quality. The central question we aim to answer is: How have greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy consumption, and air quality changed over the past two decades, and how do these metrics vary across different regions and countries?

This interactive Shiny dashboard will allow users to examine these environmental indicators over time and by region or country, providing insights into the progress toward global sustainability goals and identifying areas where more action may be needed.

We will use 3 primary datasets to address this question:

Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Data from the World Bank on total greenhouse gas emissions (in metric tons of CO₂ equivalent) by country, tracking trends over time and across regions. Source

Renewable Energy Consumption: World Bank data showing the percentage of each country’s total energy consumption derived from renewable sources. This metric offers a view of how countries are adopting renewable energy over time. Source

Air Quality: Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution levels by country, a key indicator of air quality and environmental health. Source

Using these datasets, we will create visualizations including time-series plots, bar charts, and interactive maps to explore trends and variations in sustainability metrics by time, region, and country. This dashboard will allow for an interactive examination of global environmental metrics, helping users understand how different countries and regions contribute to and mitigate environmental impact.
